    Get flow graph for performing payment computations.

    A flow graph is a connected directed networkx DiGraph where the edges
    represent account-halves and exchanges between them performed by various
    users.  Payment always flows from credit line owner to the other
    partner.

    A flow graph contains all credit lines that could possibly be used to
    transfer value from seed_node to anyone else.  It may also contain other
    account-halves so it can be cached and used for other payments.  For
    example, the flow graph might contain the set of all nodes that could
    pay or be paid by the payer.

    If ignore_balances is True, existing account balances are ignored (assumed
    to be zero), allowing for flow calculations based only credit limits,
    which can be used for reputation metrics.
    
    The flow graph assigns costs to each credit line edge in order prioritize
    settling balances.  If ignore_balances is True, costs are all zero.

    To use this graph in the min cost demand flow algorithm, assign the payer
    a supply (negative demand) and the recipient a demand equal to the payment
    amount.

    Flow graph nodes are node aliases.
