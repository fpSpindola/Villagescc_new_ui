<h3>{% trans 'Privacy' %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans %}Since Villages is meant for discovering people in your
	area, most information you give is <strong>not private</strong>.
	This includes:{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<ul>
	<li>{% trans 'Your profile information' %}</li>
	<li>{% trans 'Your posts' %}</li>
	<li>{% blocktrans %}Endorsements given and received (these are only
		available to registered users){% endblocktrans %}</li>
	<li>{% trans 'Your overall acknowledgement balance' %}</li>
</ul>

<p>{% trans 'Things that are completely or relatively private:' %}</p>

<ul>
	<li>{% trans 'Your email address' %}</li>
	<li>{% trans 'The contents of any messages sent to other users' %}</li>
	<li>{% trans 'Individual acknowledgement balances with other users' %}</li>
	<li>{% trans 'Details of acknowledgements given and received' %}
	<ul>
		<li>{% blocktrans %}When you send an acknowledgement through the
			network, the details are shared with users who are on the path
			travelled by the acknowledgement from sender to recipient.
			{% endblocktrans %}</li>
		<li>{% blocktrans %}Acknowledgement details may be available to
			more users in the future due to upcoming features.
			{% endblocktrans %}</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>{% blocktrans %}Please do not use Villages thinking that other users will
	not be able to see details of your activities. Once Villages has grown
	to a certain number of users, we may add the option to keep more of
	your details private. However, to start with, we're building a service
	for people who want to put themselves out there and connect with
	others in their community.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}If you want to try a Ripple system with more privacy,
	please check out <a href="http://ripplepay.com/">Ripplepay</a>.
	You may find it difficult to meet anybody there though

<h3>{% trans 'Anonymous Visitors' %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans %}Anonymous visitors to the site, who are not registered
	or logged in, can see your profile and your posts, but not your
	endorsements or acknowledgements. {% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans 'Search Engines' %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans %}Villages requests that search engines not index any of
	your personal data, such as your profile or your posts, so it won't
	show up on Google or any other respectable search engine, even if
	anonymous visitors to the site can view it.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans 'Real Names &amp; Handles' %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans %}Villages does <strong>not</strong> require you to
	use your real name or reveal your real-world identity in any way,
	so feel free to use any handle that your friends can recognize.
	{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans 'Tracking' %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans %}Villages will not do creepy things like track your
	every click or sell your data to third parties. That isn't who
	we are.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

{% url 'feedback' as url_feedback %}
<p>{% blocktrans %}If you have any concerns about privacy, please
